# Random-Choice-Picker 
It is a working model made for every screen using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
Through this model, we can randomly choose any one of the all the options given or available.
At first, we will write the choices in white box![RCP 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96239393/209144753-c0027b08-a96e-4768-b3bb-5805b10ad27d.png)
Then, we will click on ENTER on our keyboard.
After that it will keep on highlighting and unhightlighting all the choices for some time and then finally highlight one of them randomly.
